Adding soil sampling to household surveys: information for sample design from pilot data.  Geoderma [DETAILS TO BE UPDATED ON PUBLICATION]

It contains files with variance components for topsoil (0 - 20 cm) and subsoil (20 - 50 cm) pH and organic carbon content collected in Uganda and Ethiopia in two 
projects detailed in the paper in Geoderma.  The variance components arrive from the design of the two surveys, which correspond to Household 
Surveys conducted according to multistage random sampling designs.

For each country there is a script which, for each variable, can compute the standard error of the empirical best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP)
of the mean of the soil property at District level (Uganda) or Zone level (Ethiopia) for proposed sample designs of different size.  These
allow the quality of the information which can be obtained by supplementing such household surveys with additional sampling of soil in fields
or groups of fields belonging to households.

The paper discusses the results of this analysis, and their implications for sampling design and planning.
